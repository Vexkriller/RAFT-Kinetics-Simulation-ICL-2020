# 1st Year Undergraduate Computational Project (2020)
 
## RAFT Polymerisation Kinetics Simulation

### Written by Suleyman Bihi, Karen Pacho Dominguez, Stephen Solomou and Navraj Eari | as part of our submission for the "MATE40001 - Mathematics and Computing 1 2020-2021" module.

- Program simulates the kinetics of polymerisation as if it were a real life experiment.
- How to use:
 - Save this file into a folder anywhere on your computer.
 - Open as a .ipynb file.
 - Run this cell (information on how to change varibales detailed below.)
 - While the program is running, .txt files representing the system at that real life time (in the name) and simulated time (first row of file) will be created.
 - Once the program has finished running, 2 graphs will be produced: Probabilty against chain length and Polydispersity against real time.
 - Finished!
