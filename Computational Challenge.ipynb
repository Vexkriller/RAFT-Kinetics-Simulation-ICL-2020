    "# To obtain the lowest possible polydispersity, make k2.1 (propagation) as low as possible, and have an            appropriate value of k1.1 (initiation) to complement the other rates. A really high value of k1.1 will produce   many R0's in the system and therefore also lower the polydispersity because the other reactions 2.1 - 5.4 will   be much less likely to occur because the probabilty of k1.1 is 1. k2.1 has been set as (3.6*(10**17)) but this   value does not give the smallest possible dispersity but a higher polydispersity,therefore illustrating the      results of a more complete simulation.\n",

    "# When comparing the standard radical polymerisation against RAFTS polymerisation, polydispersity is very          similar but there's a slight increase shown by the plateau values of the polydispersity; 12 (Standard) as compared to 11.5 (RAFTS). \n",

    "# When you vary the values of I and T (from T = 0 , 10^-3 and 10^-2, and from I= 10^-2 and 10^-3) in different combinations, the polydispersity is the highest , with the smallest values of I and T (these were done with values of the pdf but altering the value of k2.1 to (3.6*10^17)and the volume 0.1 L). While increasing I and T in different combinations decreases the polydispersity, it has a very small change"
